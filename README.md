# Memory Matrix Game

A browser-based memory game inspired by the classic Simon Says game. Test your memory by repeating increasingly complex sequences of colored buttons!

## 🎮 About the Game

Memory Matrix is a simple yet challenging game where players must remember and repeat a sequence of colored button flashes. Each level adds a new color to the sequence, making it progressively harder. How far can you go?

## ✨ Features

- **Progressive Difficulty**: Each level adds one more step to the sequence
- **Visual Feedback**: Buttons flash to show the pattern you need to remember
- **Sound Effects**: Each color has a unique sound to help with memory
- **Score Tracking**: Your level is displayed as your score
- **Game Over Animation**: Visual feedback when you make a mistake
- **Keyboard Start**: Press any key to start or restart the game

## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Press any key on your keyboard to begin
2. **Watch the Pattern**: The game will flash a colored button and play its sound
3. **Repeat the Sequence**: Click the buttons in the same order as shown
4. **Advance Levels**: Successfully repeat the sequence to move to the next level
5. **Keep Going**: Each level adds one more button to the sequence
6. **Game Over**: If you click the wrong button, the game ends and shows your final score
7. **Try Again**: Press any key to restart and beat your previous score!
